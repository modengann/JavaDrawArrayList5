 *  Goal: Detect collisions and delete objects based on collision
 *  Tasks:
 *  1. Copy methods from Part 4
 *  2. Add an object of your choosing the start method
 *  3. Pass your object from #2 into the deleteRain method
 *  4. Update the deleteRain method to remove rain that collides with your chosen object
